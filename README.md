# tictactoe_AI
This invincible AI player could play Tic Tac Toe without ever losing a single game!
Attached are the AI player file that contains the code for the AI, the runner.py file which manages the graphical interface of the game, and the font style file too.

Please note: I coded the AI player itself only; however, the runner.py file was given as part of a coding challenge/project to complete.
